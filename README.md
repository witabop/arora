The goal of this project is to allow Roblox users to have a highly interfaceable simulated search engine with a random twist. This project is intended to give better search capabilities to our users rather than forcing them to be subjected to a catered selection of what is considered a “popular” universe by the standards of the Roblox application.

## Quick Launch
After pulling down just remember to run `npm install` and then you can run `npm run dev` to start the app.

## Testing
Install this vscode extension in order to run just tests indvidually for the application:
